# Color-Palettes
The base project intends to create color combinations based on randomly generated numbers and color theory for agreeable colors alongside.



The current plan:
-design a basic html visual with the maximum color cards needed (5)
-make a random color generator in js
-connect to html end

once that works, start on the individual functions for each color theory formula


upon completion of the basic random palette generator, consider the next plan:
-color-mood connotations? correlation dataset (there's an ai project that reads tweets and finds moods, this is the same style but colors)
-functionally, this would be an ai that generates a cohesive palette based on a description given
^^-we can use known words until the ai can read a typed sentence if that's needed?
